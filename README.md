Simple tracker for use with the Vortex NTNU ASV

# Steps:
1. Create the scenario simulator, based on the code I have already written in the MT3v2 fork
2. Create the PDAF math library (with custom types)
3. Add ROS2 interface
4. Add bridge to ROS1 and define the interface that can be used with the Vortex (ROS1 stack)
5. Make Rust version?? (Depending on the availability of a ROS interface for this.
